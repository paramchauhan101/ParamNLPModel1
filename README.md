# ParamNLPModel1
This is a simple chatbot implementation using Python. It utilizes several libraries to handle natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and text correction. Here's an overview of what each part does:Libraries Used:SpaCy: For processing and understanding text.NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For sentiment analysis.FuzzyWuzzy: For fuzzy string matching to correct spelling errors.Components:SpaCy Model: en_core_web_sm is a pre-trained model for SpaCy that provides various NLP capabilities like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.Sentiment Analysis: The NLTK library's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is used to determine the sentiment of user input.Fuzzy Matching: The fuzzywuzzy library helps in correcting spelling mistakes by finding the closest match from a list of choices.How it Works:Greeting Detection: Checks if the user input contains any common greetings and responds accordingly.Predefined Responses: Matches user input with predefined questions and provides appropriate responses.Emotion Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of the user's input and responds based on the detected mood (happy, sad, or neutral).Spelling Correction: Uses fuzzy matching to correct spelling errors in user input.Installation and SetupTo run this code, you need to install the required libraries and download the SpaCy model. Follow these steps:Install Required Libraries:pip install spacy nltk fuzzywuzzyDownload the SpaCy Model:Run the following command to download the en_core_web_sm model:python -m spacy download en_core_web_smDownload NLTK Data:The script includes a command to download the necessary NLTK data. If you're running the script for the first time, it will automatically download the required vader_lexicon for sentiment analysis.Once these steps are completed, you can run the provided script to start the chatbot and interact with it.
